I recently automated the login and logout functionality of Zero Bank's website using Selenium Java. The goal was to create an automated script that could simulate user behavior, saving time and effort in the login process.

Selenium is a popular web testing tool that allows users to automate browser actions. I used Selenium with Java to write a script that could automatically log in and log out of Zero Bank's website.

To automate the login and logout functionality, I first identified the necessary elements on the login and logout pages, such as the username and password fields, the login button, and the logout button.
Using Selenium with Java, I created a script that would navigate to the Zero Bank website, enter the required login credentials, click the login button, and verify that the user was successfully logged in.
Once the user was logged in, the script would navigate to the logout button and click it to log the user out of the system.

Overall, the script was successful in automating the login and logout functionality of the Zero Bank website. The script saved a significant amount of time and effort for users who would have had to manually log in and log out of the system. Additionally, the script could be run as part of a larger test suite, ensuring that the login and logout functionality was always tested thoroughly.
